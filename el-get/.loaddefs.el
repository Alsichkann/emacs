Print the current color theme function.

You can contribute this function to <URL:news:gnu.emacs.sources> or
paste it into your .emacs file and call it.  That should recreate all
the settings necessary for your color theme.

Example:

    (require 'color-theme)
    (defun my-color-theme ()
      \"Color theme by Alex Schroeder, created 2000-05-17.\"
      (interactive)
      (color-theme-install

color theme function in your .emacs directly.

Example:

    (require 'color-theme)
    (color-theme-gnome2)

defined in THEME-A and not in THEME-B, then this will not show up as a
difference, because there is no reset before installing THEME-B.  If a
face is defined in THEME-B and not in THEME-A, then this will show up as
a difference.

Install a color theme defined by frame parameters, variables and faces.

The theme is installed for all present and future frames; any missing
faces are created.  See `color-theme-install-faces'.

THEME is a color theme definition.  See below for more information.

If you want to install a color theme from your .emacs, use the output
generated by `color-theme-print'.  This produces color theme function
which you can copy to your .emacs.

A color theme definition is a list:
\([FUNCTION] FRAME-PARAMETERS VARIABLE-SETTINGS FACE-DEFINITIONS)

FUNCTION is the color theme function which called `color-theme-install'.
This is no longer used.  There was a time when this package supported
automatic factoring of color themes.  This has been abandoned.

FRAME-PARAMETERS is an alist of frame parameters.  These are installed
with `color-theme-install-frame-params'.  These are installed last such
that any changes to the default face can be changed by the frame
parameters.

VARIABLE-DEFINITIONS is an alist of variable settings.  These are
installed with `color-theme-install-variables'.

FACE-DEFINITIONS is an alist of face definitions.  These are installed
with `color-theme-install-faces'.

If `color-theme-is-cumulative' is nil, a color theme will undo face and
frame-parameter settings of previous color themes.
